## 0.4.0 - 2018-03-15

### Added

- Adds support for zend-expressive-authentication 0.4.0 and up.

### Changed

- [#10](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-authentication-session/pull/10)
  changes the constructor of the `Zend\Expressive\Authentication\Session\PhpSession`
  class to accept a callable `$responseFactory` instead of a
  `Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface` response prototype. The
  `$responseFactory` should produce a `ResponseInterface` implementation when
  invoked.

- [#10](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-authentication-session/pull/10)
  updates the `PhpSessionFactory` to no longer use
  `Zend\Expressive\Authentication\ResponsePrototypeTrait`, and instead always
  depend on the `Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface` service to correctly return
  a PHP callable capable of producing a `ResponseInterface` instance.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Removes support for zend-expressive-authentication versions prior to 0.4.0.

### Fixed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

  fixes an issue with the default username and password values defined in the
  `ConfigProvider`. Previously, these were issued as empty strings; however,
  they needed to be `null` values to ensure lookups did not provide a false
  positive.

## 0.3.0 - 2018-01-25

### Fixed

- [#1](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-authentication-session/pull/1)
  fixes how the `PhpSession` adapter both stores user details in the session,
  and retrieves them. Since zend-expressive-session does not allow object
  serialization, the class now stores the username and role in the session, and
  then populates an anonymous class implementing
  `Zend\Expressive\Authentication\UserInterface` with the values on subsequent
  requests.

Initial release.

### Added
